Noice is a Farcaster mini app designed to convert social engagement into tangible economic value. As described on hakresearch.com, Noice enables users to tip creators with USDC or its native $NOICE token for interactions such as likes, recasts, and comments, while also allowing creators to set paywalls for exclusive content. Its tagline, “Tokenizing attention as an asset,” captures its mission to bridge social and financial interactions within Farcaster’s decentralized framework.Unlike traditional social platforms where engagement metrics are largely symbolic, Noice empowers users to directly reward creators, fostering a culture of appreciation and incentivizing high-quality content. By leveraging Farcaster’s infrastructure, Noice integrates seamlessly with user wallets, making micro-transactions as intuitive as liking a post.
